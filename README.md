# 💼 Wages System

A C# console application that calculates salaries for different types of employees based on their roles, logged hours, and specific conditions like bonuses or commissions. This project demonstrates object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

  - 🔧 `Maintenance`: fixed hardship compensation
  - 👔 `Manager`: receives allowance based on total salary
  - 💼 `Sales`: gets bonus based on sales volume and commission rate

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Method Overriding (`CalculateTotal()`)
- ✅ Access Modifiers (`protected`, `private`)
- ✅ Polymorphism via overridden `ToString()` methods
- ✅ Constants and Encapsulation
